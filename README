This plugin is pretty simple and easy to use. Add the appropriate settings from the config-info.yml into your ~/.siriproxy/config.yml and bundle then start SiriProxy.
STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT
I just got my api key for OneBusAway and am currently developing. The only two commands are ..."nearest route/stop" and ..."nearest bus route/stop"
And I actually havent even tested those yet..sooo use at your own risk
